i made this project to see if i could make something in objective - c that was at least somewhat functional 
supports ios 5.1.1 and up i compiled it for armv7 v7s and arm 64 so it should work on modern iphones as well - i havent tested it though 
its very babys first programming project i used a lot of chatgpt and just hoping it would work 
known bugs 
it will not save high scores after you close out of the app 
formatting is off on where it shows you your scores so it looks like it is lower then it is 
source code coming when i fix these two bugs
it also crashes on ipad 1 5.1.1
